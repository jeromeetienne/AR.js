I am focusing hard on making AR for the web a reality.
This repository is where I publish the code.
Contact me anytime [@jerome_etienne](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne).
Stuff are still moving fast, We reached a good status tho.
An article has been published on [uploadvr](https://uploadvr.com/ar-js-efficient-augmented-reality-for-the-web/).
So I wanted to publish thus people can try it and have fun with it :)

- **Very Fast** : it runs efficiently even on phones. [60 fps on my 2 year-old phone](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/831333879810236421)!
- **Web-based** : It is a pure web solution, so no installation required. Full javascript based on three.js + jsartoolkit5
- **Open Source** : It is completely open source and free of charge!
- **Standards** : It works on any phone with [webgl](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) and [webrtc](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream)

[![AR.js 1.0 Video](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/252962/23441016/ab6900ce-fe17-11e6-971b-24614fb8ac0e.png)](https://youtu.be/0MtvjFg7tik)

# Try it on Mobile

It works on all platforms. Android, IOS and window phone. It run **any browser with WebGL and WebRTC**.
(for IOS, you need to update to ios11 and try it on Safari!)

To try on your phone is only 2 easy steps, check it out!

1. Open this [hiro marker image](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/data/images/HIRO.jpg) in your desktop browser.
1. Open this [augmented reality webapps](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/mobile-performance.html) in your phone browser, and point it
to your screen.

**You are done!** It will open a webpage which read the phone webcam, localize a hiro marker and add 3d on top of it, as you can see below.

# Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

So we shown it is now possible to do 60fps web-based augmented reality on a phone.
This is great for sure but how did we get here ? **By standing on the shoulders of giants!**
It is thanks to the hard work from others, that we can today reach this mythic 60fps AR.
So I would like to thank:

- **three.js** for being a great library to do 3d on the web.
- **artoolkit**! years of development and experiences on doing augmented reality
- **emscripten and asm.js**! thus we could compile artoolkit c into javascript
- **chromium**! thanks for being so fast!

Only thanks to all of them, I could do my part : Optimizing performance from 5fps on high-end
phone, to 60fps on 2years old phone.

After all this work done by a lot of people, we have a *web-based augmented reality solution fast enough for mobile*!

Now, many people got a phone powerful enough to do web AR in their pocket.
I think this performance improvement makes web AR a reality.
I am all exited by what people are going to do with it :)

# Performance

We are still early in the project but here are some initial numbers to give you an idea.

- I got 60fps stable on nexus6p
- Test on [iPhone 6 Plus around 60fps ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14BmEyL6gjofh276m5AosXmJrNFFYq2dO)
- Some reports [Sony Xperia Z2 (2.5 years old) runs around 50fps](https://twitter.com/leinadkalpot/status/834121238087925763) - this is a 170euro phone
- Some reports [~50fps on a old nexus5, and ~60fps on nexus 9](https://twitter.com/Ellyll/status/834312442926751744) - nexus5 is 3.5 years old!
- Some reports it working on windows phone edge!! [13fps on Lumia 950](https://twitter.com/leinadkalpot/status/834299384510763012) for some.
  [40-45fps on lumia 930](https://twitter.com/fastclemmy/status/834817155665391616) for others.

Obviously your mileage may vary. The performance you get will depend on 3 things: How heavy your 3D is, How you tune your parameters
and the hardware that you are using.

# Full Featured Marker based
With this project, we bring more performance to artoolkit.
artoolkit is a software with years of experience doing augmented reality. It is able to do a lot!

It is marker based. It supports a wide range of markers: multiple types of markers [pattern](https://artoolkit.org/documentation/doku.php?id=3_Marker_Training:marker_training)/[barcode](https://artoolkit.org/documentation/doku.php?id=3_Marker_Training:marker_barcode)
multiple independent markers at the same time, or [multiple markers acting as a single marker](https://artoolkit.org/documentation/doku.php?id=3_Marker_Training:marker_multi)
up to you to choose.

# What‚Äôs New?
Recently, we‚Äôve been getting creative and working on developing new things with AR.js. One of them is playing around with [shadows](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/837240034847764480), syncing the position of virtual lights with reality for a more life-like finish:
![screen shot 2017-03-16 at 21 06 24](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6317076/24018623/7f787ba8-0a8c-11e7-8088-fea4799b5d09.png)

We‚Äôve been collaborating very closely with [Fredrick Blomqvist](https://twitter.com/snigelpaogat). His input has had a great impact on AR.js innovation and we want to thank him. Together, we‚Äôve been implementing [refraction](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/838749280999518208), giving the 3d a transparent/glassy effect. It ended up having a nice polished look. What do you guys think?

Other crazy ideas we‚Äôve been working on include a [hole in the wall](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/836754117964017664) and a [portal into another world](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/838404908235776000). We want to take AR.js to new dimensions.

# Principles
- "Shared #ar is a lot more real than solo #AR." - Augmented reality principle [tweet](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/847889867296124933)
- "The marker must be a portal from where the virtual emerges." by @AndraConnect - #AR principles at dinner üòè [tweet](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/842112692211056640)

# Status
- At the three.js level is the main one. It is working well and efficiently
- a-frame component - it export ```<a-marker>``` tag. It becomes real easy to use.
  It allows the things three.js extension does. Here are some slides
  [aframe-artoolkit](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/slides/artoolkit-aframe/)
- webvr-polyfill: it is kind of working - still a work-in-progress

# Change Log
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

# What's Next ?

We did good on performance, but there are still a lot of room for optimisation.
Using [webworkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)
would increase cpu usage. Compiling in [webassembly](https://webassembly.org) instead
of [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) should improve loading time and likely cpu performance.
And obviously, we can still do more parameters tweaking :)


I would like people start experience augmented reality and play with it.
This is highly creative! Just look at this [puzzle game in #AR playing with mirror and laser beam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzLJb7HitvA).
You could do it with AR.js, so opensource and running on normal phones, no need to buy a new device. isn't that great!


Augmented reality on phone have applications in many fields:
[history education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyp8ZYtyu_M)
, [science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMxdBdLpVgc)
or [gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEMDgvfFUcI).
I exited to see what people will do with AR.js :)


# Browser Support
Demo tested on the following browser setups:
- **Desktop Chrome with webcam and 2 tabs** (one for Hero, one for result) (works!)
- **Android native 4.4.2** (doesn't work, doesn't ask for permission to use camera. I see white background and text)
- **Android native 5.0** (doesn't work, doesn't ask for permission, I see white background and text)
- **Chrome on Android 4.4.2** (works!)
- **Chrome on Android 5.0** (doesn't work, asks for permission, I see black background, text and a chart)
- **Safari and Chrome on iOS 8.2 (iPad)** (doesn't work, doesn't ask for permission, I see white background and text)
- **Microsoft Edge on Windows 10** (Chrome on Google Pixel phone to view hologram)

# How To Release ?

This one is mainly for [me](@jerome_etienne) to remember :)

```bash
# Update CHANGELOG.md - remove the -dev into version
atom CHANGELOG.md

# replace REVISION to the proper version, search/replace on the version string should do it
atom three.js/src/threex/threex-artoolkitcontext.js package.json README.md

# Rebuild and minify everything - aka a-frame and three.js
make minify

# Commit everything
git add . && git commit -a -m 'Last commit before release' && git push

# Go to master branch
git checkout master

# Merge dev branch into master branch
git merge dev

# tag the release
git tag 1.6.0

# push the tag on github
git push origin --tags

# push commits tag on github
git push

# update npm package.json
npm publish

# Come back to dev branch
git checkout dev

# Update CHANGELOG.md - start new dev version
atom CHANGELOG.md

# update the a-frame codepen if needed
open "https://codepen.io/jeromeetienne/pen/mRqqzb?editors=1000#0"
```
