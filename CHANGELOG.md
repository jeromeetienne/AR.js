[#344](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/pull/344)

# 1.6.1

## aframe-ar.js

- aframe-ar.js - `<a-marker>` elements will emit `markerFound` and `markerLost` events - thanks @nikolaymihaylov! Pull Request [#303](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/pull/303)

## Demos

- Created [an example](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/aframe/examples/marker-events.html) that demonstrates emitting events when markers are found and lost, and registering the respective event listeners.

# 1.6.0

- implemented patternRatio in aframe/three.js - a way to reduce the ugly black border
  - aka something to make the pattern marker border thinner
  - change (generator.html)[https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html] to support patternRatio
  - added examples in [aframe](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/aframe/examples/default-thinner-border.html) and [three.js](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/default-thinner-border.html)

# 1.5.5

- fixed barcode in a-frame #260 (thanks @basbase)
- created [portableAR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/tree/dev/three.js/contribs/portableAR.js) - a simple way to port ar.js to a non-three.js framework
  - it is in /three.js/contribs/portableAR.js
  - in [examples/](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/tree/dev/three.js/contribs/portableAR.js/examples/babylon.js) you can find babylon.js using portableAR.js
- made webvr-polyfill obsolete
  - it was more a toy than something currently useful
  - it was far from complete, not even in a workable state, anyway
- reorganized ```examples/``` folder
  - created ```demos/``` to contain working demos
  - created ```experiments/``` to contain work in progress

## Tests
- Made tests to report failure - yeah i know it is silly but before it reported
- Added test to measure performance : fps
- Added test for markers-area learning and usage
- Added test for artoolkit, aruco and hit-testing

# 1.4.10

- support for markers-area
  - Efficient user friendly area scanning
  - More Versatile than single marker tracking 0 larger areas than single markers

  - More Stable than single marker tracking - position is averaged based on visible markers
- Support for multiple tracking
- single api for all tracking
- tango support
- support for aruco WIP - all included but need to fix pose estimation

---

# 1.3.0

**Totally incomplete**

- added smoothedControls - everything tunable via parameters
  - it applies LERP for position/quaternion/scale on sub-controls
  - if display controls object3d when sub-controls has been visible for minVisibleDelay
  - if display controls object3d when sub-controls has been unvisible for minUnvisibleDelay
- did THREEx.ArMarkerHelper to help visualize marker
- AR-Code generator - see [AR-Code Generator](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/arcode.html)
- liquid markers are in!
  [water tweet](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/844681159112036356) -

- early work about videoInWebgl - a important componant of phone-in-hmd usecase
  [first tweet](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/846805050118864897)
- better handling of .baseUrl in aframe default parameters
- fixed artoolkit projection matrix to be more webgl - [projection matrix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/WebGL_model_view_projection)
  - it was looking to positive-z and y was upside down compared to the usual webgl one
- Change marker axis - now positive-y is normal to the marker
- Added logo by @tentone - [AR.js logo](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/data/logo/logo-black-transparent-1280x512.png)
Nice and slick! thanks @tentone

# 0.9.0 - Initial Release

I worked a lot on WebAR.
But i recently reached [60fps on mobile phones](https://twitter.com/jerome_etienne/status/831333879810236421).
so i think WebAR is now ready to be released :)

I will keep the usual branch model

- stable release on master branch
- current release on dev branch
- features in progress on their own branch
